#Navigating Complex Data

Write your code inside of `main.js`, and run your file from the terminal with `node main.js`. Use Javascript to:

1.) Find all results that have `kind` of `shopping#product`. How many are there? Where else is this count information stored in the search results?

2.) `Console.log` all items with `availability` set to `backorder`

3.) Find the items with more than one image link, and store them in an array.

4.) Console.log all products made by Canon

5.) Print all items with a product author name of "eBay" and brand "Canon".
